### Summary:

This repository presents a cutting-edge deep learning-based method for automatically segmenting brain tumours from MRI images. Leveraging the power of `U-Net` convolutional neural networks, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available BraTS dataset. The methodology involves thorough data preprocessing, augmentation, and model training with a five-fold cross-validation technique. The results demonstrate exceptional accuracy and potential for transforming medical image analysis. The repository includes detailed documentation, code implementation, and model evaluation metrics.
